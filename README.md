# pygame_platformer

Simple game to teach myself programming. Requires python 2.7 and pygame 1.9. 

Uses pytmx version 3.20 to allow loading of .tmx map files. pytmx is licensed under LGPL v3:  https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX

To update the pytmx library, download the newest build from https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX and replace the pytmx folder
with the pytmx folder from bitcraft's repository.
 
Updating pytmx possibly requires you to modifiy the tilerenderer.py file.

It also uses the "six"-module by "gutworth". "six" is licensed under MIT: https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six




Arrow keys for directional movement and jumping, space to throw fireballs.
