Simple game to teach myself programming. Requires python 2.7 and pygame 1.9.2a0 win32 bit: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Uses pytmx version 3.20 to allow loading of .tmx map files. pytmx is licensed under LGPL v3:  https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX

To update the pytmx library, download the newest build from https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX and replace the pytmx folder
with the pytmx folder from bitcraft's repository.
 
Updating pytmx possibly requires you to modifiy the tilerenderer.py file.
